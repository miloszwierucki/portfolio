This website does not use any client-side tracking. I only use simple server-side analytics via **Vercel Analytics**, to get a sense of traffic and where it comes from. This data cannot be used to uniquely identify visitors. More information is available at: [https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy).

The contact form available on the website sends messages directly to my email address via the **Resend**. No data is stored on the website’s server.
More information about the company’s privacy policy can be found at: [https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy).
