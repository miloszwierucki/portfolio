I'm a Programmer at **[360SoftwareHouse](https://360softwarehouse.com)**, where I create modern, responsive web applications. I'm studying Applied Computer Science at the [Lodz University of Technology](https://ftims.p.lodz.pl/en), which allows me to combine learning with practice, continuously enhancing my skills.

I focus on details and strive for perfection in every project, believing that excellence lies in the small elements. My goal is to build products that provide users with engaging and unique experiences.

I serve as the **Chairman of the IT Committee** in the [Student Government at the Lodz University of Technology](https://samorzad.p.lodz.pl), where I'm responsible for leading a team tasked with the development and maintenance of the organization’s IT systems, including the implementation of new technologies and ensuring security and accessibility for the academic community.

Outside of programming, I'm interested in 3D visualization of spaces and objects.\
**When I'm not in front of a computer screen**, I'm probably working out at the gym, running, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
